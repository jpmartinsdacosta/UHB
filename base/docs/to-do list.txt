TO-DO LIST:

# Singular TO-DO LIST so that I don't forget to do stuff.

2. Add an additional flag to filelink if an DAC, ACL or MAC command is recursive and affects already added policy.
Also warn the user when validating the configuration file.

3. Create all necessary functions to check conflicts between DAC and ACL first, then MAC last.
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND:
    a) If MAC is not being used, DAC sets permissions and ACL makes it more granular.
    ACL is basically a more complicated DAC...
        ACL > DAC
    b) If MAC is being used, then MAC takes full precedence.
        MAC > ACL > DAC

4 IMPORTANT: Create a function that gets the users options when creating ACL and MAC policy (separately) and transforms them into the 
CORRECT flags when writing to the config file.

Create an array of strings for each system executable that is used for DAC, ACL and MAC separately.

Select a few of them and create an array of strings for "UHB".

The user will use the flags provided by UHB and then "translate" the flags from one array of strings to another.
