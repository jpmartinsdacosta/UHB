TO-DO LIST:

# Singular TO-DO LIST so that I don't forget to do stuff.

1. Create a function in config.c that searches a specific string's position, and starts writing BELOW that string.
Make sure to add a blank line after writing just in case. This is needed for writing policy in the correct part of
the config file.

OR

Separate everything into their respective files and combine them one by one in order.

2. Add an additional flag to filelink if an DAC, ACL or MAC command is recursive and affects already added policy.
Also warn the user when validating the configuration file.

3. Create all necessary functions to check conflicts between DAC and ACL first, then MAC last.
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND:
    a) If MAC is not being used, DAC sets permissions and ACL makes it more granular.
    ACL is basically a more complicated DAC...
        ACL > DAC
    b) If MAC is being used, then MAC takes full precedence.
        MAC > ACL > DAC

4 IMPORTANT: Create a function that gets the users options when creating DAC, ACL and MAC policy (separately) and transforms them into the 
CORRECT flags when writing to the config file.

Create an array of strings for each system executable that is used for DAC, ACL and MAC separately.

Select a few of them and create an array of strings for "UHB".

The user will use the flags provided by UHB and then "translate" the flags from one array of strings to another.
