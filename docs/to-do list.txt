TO-DO LIST:

# Singular TO-DO LIST so that I don't forget to do stuff.

1. Create a function in config.c that searches a specific string's position, and starts writing BELOW that string.
Make sure to add a blank line after writing just in case. This is needed for writing policy in the correct part of
the config file.

2. Add an additional flag to filelink if an DAC, ACL or MAC command is recursive and affects already added policy.
Also warn the user when validating the configuration file.

3. Create all necessary functions to check conflicts between DAC and ACL first, then MAC last.
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND:
    a) If MAC is not being used, DAC sets permissions and ACL makes it more granular.
    ACL is basically a more complicated DAC...
        ACL > DAC
    b) If MAC is being used, then MAC takes full precedence.
        MAC > ACL > DAC
